Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter.

.class
#id

- element
  element, element
  element element
  element > element
  element + element
  :hover
  :last-child
  :first-child
  !important (not recommended)

What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order
